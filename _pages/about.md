3rd year Robotics Engineering student at UC Santa Cruz with a focus on AI and autonomous technologies. I’ve worked on software-defined radios and RF jamming at the Naval Air Warfare Center, contributed to AV research involving LLMs and sensor robustness, and am currently an AI/ML Fellow at Cornell Tech. I’ve led multidisciplinary teams, published research, and enjoy building intelligent systems that bridge software and hardware. Always open to connecting over robotics, machine learning, or research collaborations. Reach me via [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/denise-ataei) or at denise.ataei1010@gmail.com.
