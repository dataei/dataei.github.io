3rd year Robotics Engineering student at UC Santa Cruz with a focus on AI and autonomous technologies. I’ve worked on software-defined radios and radio-frequency jamming at the Naval Air Warfare Center, contributed to autonomous vehicle research involving LLMs and sensor robustness, and was an AI/ML Fellow at Cornell Tech. I’ve led multidisciplinary teams, published research, and enjoy building intelligent systems that bridge software and hardware. Always open to connecting over robotics, machine learning, or research collaborations.
